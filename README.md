## Build

This project uses Netlify to build production app every time a PR is merged to master branch. Also, builds PR previews so changes can be checked before merging to master.

## Running tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests.

Run `npm run test:coverage` to generate test coverage.

Run `npm run lint` to execute tslint.

Lint and unit tests run automatically on `git push` and all needs to pass before the branch is actually pushed to remote.
